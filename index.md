### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1
This was one of the more memorable lab for me due to the fact that it was the first ever time i ever coded C++. It was mostly confusing when it comes to suffeling around but in the end it was quite fun and a very nice start to get into C++ as a whole.

Lab 8, part 2
This is my second favorite lab due to the fact that it was all about making a game of poker. It was very most interesting one since it was coding an entire game from scratch. I never really play poker before so it was one ofthe more intruguing thing for me . It was at most challenging trying to figure out how to code in the function to tell it when to add a +10 on the Ace card or not. Over all one of the most interesting but also fun thing to code in my eyes.

lab 9, part 2
this is one of the most interesting one that there is  as we have to make two strings put statement of true, however if it has an e it detect as false. In this exercise we where suppose to take a respond that is put into the code to go through where the computer check one by one check if it equal to e or not. I find it nice to have a way to be able to take out a string to analyse to see if it should be put out as false or true in the input statement.
